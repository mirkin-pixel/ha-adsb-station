"""What you can ask out loud, for the ADS-B Station integration.

"What is flying over?" is the question the whole receiver was put on the roof
for, and it is a better question to ask a room than to look up on a dashboard:
you ask it while looking out of the window.

Five of them, answered out of the last poll. The names come from the tables
this integration already ships, so the answer is "KLM flight 1234" rather than
"kilo lima mike one two three four", and it is spoken without a single request
leaving your network — which is the difference between this and asking a
speaker in the corner what is overhead.

The sentences that reach these handlers are not here. Home Assistant reads
those out of your configuration directory alone, so they ship as files and are
put there by you or by `adsb_station.install_sentences`.
