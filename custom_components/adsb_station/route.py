"""Where a flight came from and where it is going.

Nothing an aircraft broadcasts says this. Mode S and ADS-B carry the callsign
and nothing else about the flight, so `KLM1234` is all that reaches the
antenna: the route behind that number lives in a database on the ground. Every
map that shows you a route, tar1090 included, asks someone else for it.

That makes this the one part of the integration that leaves your network, and
it is why it stays off until you pick a source. Two are on offer, and they do
not always agree with each other, which is a fair warning about how certain
any of this is:

* adsbdb.com answers about one callsign at a time.
* routeset is what tar1090 uses. It takes every callsign in one request, and
  because it is given the position as well it can say whether the route it
  found actually fits an aircraft seen there.

Both offer the airline as well and neither is asked for it. That name follows
from the callsign, which means it can be looked up in a table on your own disk
for every flight rather than for the ones a source happens to know.

Only the aircraft inside your radius are ever looked up, and answers are kept
for the day, so a station watching a busy sky still asks a handful of
questions an hour rather than one per aircraft per poll.
